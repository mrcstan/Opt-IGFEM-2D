- careful when plotting G_history.fval as those later than parallelTwoAdjThree are multiplied 
  by objScale/domainArea^(1/normp). Those before are not. 
- 1/15 For the following simulations, SUPG may have been applied wrongly (when the flow rate in a channel is negative):
i) parallelTwoAdjTwo
ii) parallelTwoAdjThree
iii) parallelTwoBounded
iv) parallelStephenAdjOne_1sim1
v) parallelTwoAdjInitBar_n_Config

- 1/15 SUPG has been fixed

- 1/16 made correction to polygon_area to give signed area

- 1/16 manual scaling applied to objective function and area constraint

- 1/16 parallelStephenAdjSqpOne and parallelStephenAdjSqpOne: tolcon=tolX=tolfun=1e-6. triangles are merged 

- 1/18 impose constraint on distance between certain pairs of vertices

- 1/19 Added extra side triangles that are allowed to move or stay fixed
