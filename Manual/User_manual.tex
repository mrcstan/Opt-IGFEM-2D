\section{Objective}
\label{sec_objective}
This project optimizes channel designs in 2D rectangular domain by combining a 2D polynomial IGFEM solver (in the directory microchannels-IGFEM-2D), sensitivity analysis \cite{Tan16,Najafi15} and gradient-based optimization algorithms in MATLAB. It can do three types of optimization:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Standard optimization (Sec.\ \ref{subsec_standard_optimization})
\item Generation of Pareto front (Sec.\ \ref{subsec_generation_of_pareto_front})
\item Optimization of `worst-case scenario' (Sec.\ \ref{subsec_worst_case_scenario}) 
\end{enumerate}


\section{Compilation}
Ensure that microchannels-IGFEM-2D works before trying to run this project. This project requires the compilation of some Mex functions to work. See README in the parent directory for more information. 

\section{Inputs}
The project can be run from either of these main scripts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  \texttt{main.m},
\item  \texttt{main\_pareto.m},
\item \texttt{main\_blocked\_channels.m},
\end{enumerate}
which respectively call
\begin{enumerate}
\item  \texttt{optimize\_channels.m}, 
\item \texttt{generate\_pareto\_front.m},
\item  \texttt{optimize\_blocked\_channels.m}
\end{enumerate}
respectively for the three types of optimization listed in Sec.\ \ref{sec_objective}. 

Many other inputs similar to those in \texttt{main.m} of microchannels-IGFEM-2D can also be set in the last three functions. One can also set the optimization algorithm, optimization tolerances, gauss quadrature for the sensitivity analysis (which could be different from that of the FEM analysis) etc. The inputs that can be set by the user are clearly explained and delineated in the functions.

\subsection{Standard optimization}
\label{subsec_standard_optimization}
Standard optimization minimizes an objective such as $p$-norm of the temperature, variance of temperature etc subject to non-linear constraints such as pressure drop, maximum temperature and area fraction \cite{Tan16}. The input arguments for \texttt{optimize\_channels.m} are described in Table \ref{tab_optimize_channels_inputs1} and \ref{tab_optimize_channels_inputs2}.

\subsection{Generation of Pareto front}
\label{subsec_generation_of_pareto_front}
Pareto fronts involving up to three objectives are generated using the normalized normal constraint method \cite{Messac03}. Objectives available are $p$-norm of temperature, pressure drop and area fraction. The input arguments for \texttt{generate\_pareto\_front.m} are described in Table \ref{tab_generate_pareto_front_inputs1} and \ref{tab_generate_pareto_front_inputs2}.

\begin{table}[!h]
\caption{Input arguments for \texttt{generate\_pareto\_front.m}.}
\label{tab_generate_pareto_front_inputs1}

\begin{tabular}{|c|L|}
\hline
Argument \# & Description\\
\hline
1 & Input channel file name (see User\texttt{\_}manual in the IGFEM-Curves-2D directory about the channel input file format and the GUI tool used to generate the file) \\
\hline
2 & File for imposing geometric constraints to prevent self-intersection (see Sec.\ \ref{subsec_geometrical_constraint}). Set to [ ] if not applicable. \\
\hline
3 & Output directory in the same directory as \texttt{main\_pareto.m} \\
\hline
4 & File prefix for the output files \\
\hline
5 & Vector of the number of elements in each direction \\
\hline
6 & Vector of the domain bounds [xi,xf,yi,yf], where xi,xf,yi,yf are respectively the left, right, bottom and top coordinates of the domain \\
\hline
7 & Cost function type. Any combination of the following strings delimited by a comma: \texttt{T} ($p$-norm of temperature field), 
\texttt{P} (pressure drop) and \texttt{A} (area fraction). Example: \texttt{`T,P'} means that the Pareto front with the $p$-norm and pressure
drop as the first and second objectives, respectively are to be generated. If it is \texttt{`P,T'}, the first objective is the pressure drop. \\
\hline
8 & $p$ of $p$-norm. Only applicable when \#7 contains \texttt{P} \\
\hline
9 & Matrix of unnormalized anchor points with the $i$-th column being the objective values corresponding to the minimization
of the $i$-th objective \textit{alone}. Example: say \#7$==$ \texttt{`T,P'}, the objective values corresponding to the minimization of 
the $p$-norm alone are respectively $T^{(T)}$ and $P^{(T)}$ and those corresponding to the minimzation of the pressure drop alone are
respectively $T^{(P)}$ and $P^{(P)}$. Then the matrix should be [$T^{(T)}$,$T^{(P)}$;$P^{(T)}$,$P^{(P)}$].
Note that to obtain $T^{(P)}$ and $P^{(P)}$, one has to impose a lower bound on the area fraction and this area fraction should be 
chosen so that $P^{(P)}$ is far from the Pareto front region of interest. \\
\hline
10 & Number of points in first objective direction on hyperplane including the end points. If the Pareto front of three objectives are needed, 
the number of points in the other direction would be calculated by such that the spacings of the points are equal in each direction. 
The function that subdivides the hyperplane (\texttt{NNC\_parameters.m}) cannot handle more than three objectives.   \\

\subsection{Optimization of `worst-case scenario'}
\label{subsec_worst_case_scenario}
Optimization of `worst-case scenario' minimizes the worst objective function among a set of objective functions each obtained by blocking a subset of channels of the network. (The subset of blocked channels must not cause the solution to be undefined.) The minimax problem is converted into a single objective optimization following the formulation in \cite{Charalambous78}. The input arguments for \texttt{optimize\_blocked\_channels.m} are described in Table \ref{tab_optimize_blocked_channels_inputs1} and \ref{tab_optimize_blocked_channels_inputs2}.

\subsection{Geometrical constraint file}
This file enables triangles/quads to be constructed for applying geometrical constraints. Note that only the use of triangles has been tested extensively and some data in the file is not applicable when quads are used. The format of the file is as follows: 
\label{subsec_geometrical_constraint}
\begin{verbatim}
polygons, <number of polygons,p>
v11 v12 ... v1n1
v21 v22 ... v2n2
...
vp1 vp2 ... vpnp
# where v11 v12 etc are vertex numbers
   
vertexCoords, <number of vertexCoords,c>
x11 x12 
x21 x22
...
xc1 xc2

vertices2params, <number of maps, m>
vp11 vp12
vp21 vp22
...
vpm1 vpm2
# vpij means the design parameter corresponding the j coordinate of the
# ith vertex. If the vertex coordinate does not map to any design
# parameter, the corresponding entry should be nan
   
# the data from here onwards is only applicable when all polygons are
# triangles
restrictedParams, <number of restricted parameters, r>
val1
val2
...
valr
# restrictedParams are design parameters where the values are
# restricted to be equal to some other design parameters
# these extra parameters are introduced to increase the flexibility of
# the side triangles when applying the geometrical constraints 
# val1, val2, ...are the inital values of these restricted parameters

paramPairs, r
pp11 pp12
pp21 pp22
...
ppr1 ppr2
# (pp11,pp12) is a pair consisting of a restricted parameter and 
# a partner design parameter
   
sideTriangles, <number of side triangles, s>
triangle1
triangle2
...
trianglep
# these are the side triangles among those listed under polygons
\end{verbatim}
Many examples can be found in the files ending with the extension `polygon' in the directory ChannelFiles. 

\subsection{Initial design file}
The initial design file (also called sample file) is used to start the optimization with different initial designs. The format of the file is as follows:
\label{subsec_initial_design_file}
\begin{verbatim}
nSamples, <number of initial designs>
nParams, <number of design parameters>
val11
val12
...
val1nParams
...
...
valnSamples1
valnSamples2
...
valnSamplesnParams
\end{verbatim}
Examples of the files can be found in the directory ChannelFiles with extensions `lhs', `rand', `rand1' and `smmp', which respectively indicate that the initial designs are generated using the Latin hypercube sampling method, shuffling within bounding boxes, random generation of quads for generating parallel networks and random generation of vertices followed by subgraph monomorphism to connect the vertices. 

\subsection{Blocked channel file}
\label{subsec_blocked_channel_file}
This file indicates which channels to block to produce a set of objectives corresponding to each blockages, among which the worst-case at each iteration is optimized for. One must ensure that none of the blockages produce an undefined objective.  
\begin{verbatim}
<set 1 channel numbers>
<set 2 channel numbers>
...
<set n channel numbers>
\end{verbatim}
Examples can be found in the directory blockedChannelFiles. 

\subsection{Running multiple jobs concurrently in LINUX}
LINUX scripts are available to generate multiple main scripts so that multiple jobs can be run independently on different processors. Scripts for the SSM machines and the Taub cluster can be found in the directories SSM21\texttt{\_}scripts and  Taub\texttt{\_}scripts. The scripts for the SSM machines can simply be run by issuing the command \texttt{./<script name with extension `run'>} in the terminal. The scripts will generate a main MATLAB script for each job to be run and execute the jobs in the background. To run jobs in Taub, one must submit a pbs script by issuing the command \texttt{qsub  <pbs script>}, which would then execute a script with the extension `run'.

\section{Outputs}
Many files are produced at the beginning, during and after the optimization every iteration or every function evaluation. The files may be updated/replaced or a new one produced at each iteration. The description of the output files are shown in Table \ref{tab_optimization_output_files}.

These files are updated at every iteration. \\
\hline
